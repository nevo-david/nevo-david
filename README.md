## Welcome

My name is Nevo. I have been a full-stack/team leader developer for the last ten years 🙇🏻‍♂️

You might know me for a few things:
 
- 📳 Head of growth at [Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/) (took Novu from 0 to 30k stars.)
- 📰 Running [GitHub20k](https://www.github20k.com/) is the place to learn about open-source growth.
- 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 Running [HackSquad](https://hacksquad.dev/), the second biggest event of October with 10k+ participants.
- 👍🏻 Building [ClickVote](https://clickvote.dev/) in my spare time as a hobby project - Give likes, upvotes, and reviews to any context!
