## Welcome

My name is Nevo I am a full-stack / team leader developer for the last 10 years üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I work at **Novu** - the open-source notification infrastructure for developers and love every moment of it.

Novu helps you send notifications in different ways like In-App messages, Push notifications, Email, SMS, and Chat in a single unified API.
It lets you customize how your notifications work and when they are sent, so you can make sure they reach people in the best way possible.

## Growing Novu to 20K stars
Lately Novu achieved 20k stars.

What usually takes companies around 3-4 years, [we have made with one](https://star-history.com/#novuhq/novu&Date).


**I love how open-source projects grow.**

And I tend to write about it in my [GitHub20k Blog](https://www.github20k.com/blog)

Feel free also to like and star my repository: [Super-Star](https://github.com/github-20k/super-star) an open-source course you can use for you needs.
