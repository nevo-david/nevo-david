## Welcome

My name is Nevo I am a full-stack / team leader developer for the last 10 years 🙇🏻‍♂️

I work at **Novu** - the open-source notification infrastructure for developers and love every moment of it.

Novu helps you send notifications in different ways like In-App messages, Push notifications, Email, SMS, and Chat in a single unified API.
It lets you customize how your notifications work and when they are sent, so you can make sure they reach people in the best way possible.
