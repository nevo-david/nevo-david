## Welcome

My name is Nevo. I have been a full-stack/team leader developer for the last ten years 🙇🏻‍♂️

You might know me for a few things:

- 📳 I was the head of growth at [Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/) (took Novu from 0 to 31k stars.)
- 📰 Running [Gitroom](https://gitroom.com/), the place to learn about open-source growth.
- 📰 Founder of [Postiz](https://postiz.com/), the ultimate social media scheduling tool.
- 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 Running [HackSquad](https://hacksquad.dev/), the second biggest event of October with 10k+ participants.
